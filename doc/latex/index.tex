{\bfseries Welcome to Engineering Drawing Software source documentation!}~\newline
~\newline
We hope you\textquotesingle{}ll find it a convenient tool to explore, understand and experiment with the internals of the program.~\newline
~\newline
Being generated from the actual state of the code, this documentation is by no means a well structured corpus or a textbook, but more an utility to browse through the sources.~\newline
~\newline
Don\textquotesingle{}t hesitate to rebuild an up to date doc from source as often as needed.~\newline
